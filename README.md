angularjs-auto-validate
=======================

The goal of this is to wrap the Dynamic Angular Validation module "angular-auto-validate" by Jon Samwell (https://jonsamwell.github.io/angular-auto-validate/) in a NuGet package for Visual Studio consumption.

The source repo is here: https://github.com/jonsamwell/angular-auto-validate
And a blog post about it here: http://jonsamwell.com/dynamic-angularjs-validation/

All credits go to Jon Samwell. 
This repo supports his efforts with a NuGet distribution.
